Problem
1. The Secret Recipe
A famous chef is preparing a dish and has a list of ingredients, each with a specific quantity(e.g.,"Sugar: 200g","Flour: 500g"). The chef wants to ensure that each ingredient
quantity is within a range (e.g., between 100g and 1000g).

Write a program that:
● Takes a list of ingredients with their quantities as input.
● Checks if any ingredient has a quantity outside the allowed range.
● Returns a message indicating which ingredients need adjustment.
